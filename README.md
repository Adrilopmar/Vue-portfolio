# Welcome to my updated portfolio made with VUEjs
The aim of this project is to update my portfolio made with Angular. So keep practicing and learning 
after the bootcamp of VUEjs I coursed in Iron Hack. Once this portfolio is finished, the old one will be posted as a project among all others personal projects.

## Road map
### 02/11/2022
Today I've decided starting updating my protfolio. In order to improve, refresh and learn while coding, this portfolio is going to be coded with VUE and typeScript. 
I have never used TS with VUE so it will be a challenge. I faced the "horror" of TS and learn its basics when I started programming with Angular.
Actually, one of the main reason is because it's been a long time without usig TS and it might be a bit rusty.

It's been a week working and not updating README. I've been working on side bar with Naive UI, the single project component, router... Actually we can say that the portfolio is being setting up. 
Quite happy of the progress even there are not many things done but the "skeleton" it's getting shape and everything is going as planned. 
So let's keep going. I am really enjoying this!
